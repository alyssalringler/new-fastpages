The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. I read the question wrong and thought it was asking for a possible string element."

The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50."

    "**Final Reflection** Overall, I think I uderstoood all of the conepts on the test and most of my mistakes were made because I didn't read the entire question. When going over missed questions, I read the College Board explanation and made sure I understood why I got the question wrong. Then I went back to questions with the same skill that I got correct to make sure I understood the concepts it was covering. I noticed that 2 of the three questions I missed were part of skill set 4, so I will be sure to review that before the AP Exam."
